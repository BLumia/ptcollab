- dynamic height and width
- stopping and starting via space
- seeking
- background
- edit different units
- update last measure is recognized by moo
 - configurable quantization
   - toggle on / off
   - drop down for speccing it
- play / stop buttons
- Saving file
- middle click drag
- have it look decent on scroll limits
5/31
- hear note on play (HARD) - had to factor out the logic independent of the current unit play position
- fix the offset
- zoom according to where cursor is right now
- tried the linear smoothing thing. it was way out of wack. not convergent.
- undo

6/04
- Implement the undo system drawpile uses
- Fix a few things like broken redo (no more chnaging of length 0)

6/6
1. Hook up the network. didn't get working b/c I was distracted but things are
   sending and I think they're generally connected!
2. Status bar, saving with network, reconnecting / starting new server etc.
3. Send view changes / edit state changes.
4. Redo in the right order
5. Demo it in a video, test with friends

6/7
1. Fix issue where other ppl's cursors show up in the wrong position
2. Hook up show-all checkbox properly
3. Users can specify names, show up next to cursor
4. Cursor disappears if user leaves / disconnect from server
5. Show list of connected users on left
6. fixed random bug where startup would loop forever if the file was too big

6/8
1. fix crash when you hold down a non-looping sample for too long
2. realize it's hard to fix the blip
3. I think fixed crash on server restart

TODO:
 - edit while playing soundness
 - show measure num, set loop points
 - Unit view, at least for drums

Synchronization:
 - Changes to units / adding voices?
 - drawpile autoresets, so that server doesn't have to send whole history over.
   - probably goes hand-in-hand with undo stack, which drawpile limits to
     globally 30. probably a good idea so we don't keep on growing in memory
   - undo stack is probably sth like: all committed local history prunes after
     reaching size X
   - autoreset is then being able to supply a base ptcop + a history with size
     > X
   - Undo stack isn't actually that important, usually only undo 1-2 at a time.
     But also, cheap to have a large stack.

Editor QoL:
 - Time bar at the top
 - lower bar for editing volume?
 - editing volume, etc. in bottom bar
 - follow playhead
 - Speed things up.
   - Separate audio thread with locking.
   - Bounding boxes for the undos/redos
     - At least on remote action rollback. You have to undo a prefix from the tip.
     - Also possibly useful for actual undos.
       - actually probably not useful for actual undos because there are cases
         where you'd have to roll everything back anyway.
   - Indexes for searching through list fast
     - according to botb event limit is 500k in the regular editor; here the
       limit is 1M.

       could probably handle 1000 events with little lag (1000 events * 1000
       actions = 1M iterations, not too much)
 - don't blip when seeking and playing again (hard due to QAudioOutput behavior)

Edit while playing soundness (low priority, unlikely to hit)
 - Add things between last event and next (before / after now?)
 - Delete things. Don't strand the pointer
 - Adjust the length of ON

Low priority:
 - Workflow: Copy paste - maybe not that important b/c when writing with others you're
   probably just going to be adding notes with them. it's much more like
   doodling! Or at least, it is right now.
 - Editor UI: Piano on the left
 - Misc UI: Recent connections dropdown
 - Custom icon for people's names?

Just general format? improvements:
 - A kind of meta instrument that changes depending on parameter or pitch
