## Information
Check out the <a href="https://yuxshao.github.io/ptcollab/">landing page</a>
for more info about pxtone collab, including downloads, guides, further
links, and thank yous.

## Installation
The <a href="https://github.com/yuxshao/ptcollab/releases">releases page</a>
has executables you can download and just run!

If you're building from source, it should work with a Qt5.15 install, but does
require ogg/vorbis and C++17.

On Mac, you may need to install a later version of clang (e.g., through `brew
install llvm`).

If you have these dependencies , running `qmake` and then `make` should build
an executable for you.
